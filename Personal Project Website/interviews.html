            <h1>Interview with a Teenage Influencer</h1>
            <h3>1. Social media is designed to keep us hooked. How do you manage your screen time while creating content?</h3>
            <p>It involves creating balance and discipline. Without these, it becomes impossible to manage your screen time effectively. As a content creator, creating content demands careful planning, focus, and prioritizing what is important for the day. Maintaining this kind of structure while balancing screen time with offline activities is essential for sustaining productivity and well-being.</p>
       
            <h3>2. With filters and curated posts everywhere, how do you stay authentic online? Do you feel pressured to fit certain beauty standards?</h3>
            <p>Being authentic online is the most important thing when it comes to posting on social media, especially as an influencer. Social media should inspire, motivate, and entertain people, not leave them feeling bad or with negative thoughts after using the app. When I think of the word "authentic," I think of something genuine and real, not copied or false. Everyone has their own unique fingerprint, and there’s only one version of you, which makes you special. There’s no need to feel pressured to fit into certain beauty standards because your character and the way you authentically represent yourself on social media are what truly make you beautiful.

                Of course, it can be difficult for many people who wish to meet certain beauty standards when they see the "perfect" picture in front of them, but we all know that much of what we see is edited. Even when pictures aren’t edited and are naturally beautiful, you don’t know the person representing herself in real life. Beauty doesn’t come just from the outside; it also comes from the inside.</p>

            <h3>3. Does social media ever make you feel stressed or anxious? How do you deal with that?</h3>
            <p>Social media stresses me out every day. It is a huge platform, and firstly, creating content can be very stressful, but also the energy of certain stereotypes on social media can make you feel overwhelmed. Personally, dealing with that stress goes in diverse ways. If I feel constantly "attracted" to social media while feeling stressed at the same time when opening the app, it’s time for a Social Media Diet, which I am currently following.

                Of course, social media can be a great tool for online businesses and promotion, which I also use it for. Referring back to my social media diet, it doesn’t mean you delete the app and cut yourself off from the online world; it just means you schedule times into the calendar when needed and avoid wasting time scrolling through the app.</p>

            <h3>How do you use your platform to spread positivity and promote mental health?</h3>
            <p>I am convinced that social media is full of positivity if you use it right and wisely. The power of connection is definitely key—if you see, especially women, succeed, be happy for them, congratulate them, and don’t be jealous. If you spread positivity, it will come back to you. By embracing the power of connection towards others, you create a supportive community that uplifts and encourages one another, fostering a space where positivity and mental health thrive.            </p>
