            <p> 41% of teens with the highest social media use rate their overall mental health as poor or very poor, compared to 23% of those with the lowest use. Additionally, 10% of the highest-use group reported suicidal intent or self-harm in the past 12 months, double the rate of the lowest-use group. </p>

            <h3>Instagram & Social Media's Correlation With Depression & Anxiety</h3>
            <p>The impact of Instagram on teen mental health is significant, with research linking prolonged use of the platform to heightened levels of anxiety and depression. The curated nature of posts often leads to unrealistic comparisons, fostering feelings of inadequacy. According to studies, frequent Instagram use correlates with a decline in life satisfaction and increased mood disorders among teens.</p>
        <p>Features such as infinite scrolling and persistent notifications can also disrupt sleep, a critical factor for adolescent well-being. Blue light from screens combined with the psychological pressure to stay updated contributes to irregular sleep patterns and greater social jetlag</p>
        <p>Instagram’s tendency to encourage comparisons with idealized images, increases stress and anxiety, linked to higher levels of cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands when stressed. While cortisol is essential for managing short-term stress, prolonged exposure can contribute to anxiety and depression. Additionally, Instagram’s reward system—likes and comments—releases dopamine, a chemical in the brain that reinforces habits. This cycle fosters compulsive use and emotional dependency, increasing feelings of flaw and mental health challenges, especially in teens.</p>
