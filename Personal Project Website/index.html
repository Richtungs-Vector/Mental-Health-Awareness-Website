            <h3>Instagram & Social Media Addiction</h3>
            <p>Addiction to social media is often dismissed, yet has become an incresing issue amongst teenagers. Adolescents spend an average of 145 minutes daily on social platforms, with Instagram being a major contributor. The app’s design triggers dopamine pathways, creating a reward system that keeps users hooked. The nucleus accumbens or 'pleasure center' in the brain is the same area activated when hard drugs such as cocaine are consumed. Instagram’s design keeps users engaged through features like likes, comments, and notifications, which activate dopamine pathways in the brain, reinforcing addictive behaviors. The pandemic intensified this trend, with many teens turning to Instagram for connection during periods of isolation.</p>
        <p>Social media addiction not only disrupts daily routines but also impacts mental health, leading to stress, anxiety, and sleep deprivation. Solutions such as disabling notifications, setting daily app limits, and utilizing screen time management apps have proven effective. It’s also important to maintain a balanced approach to social media use, as moderate usage can have positive effects, such as facilitating connections and accessing educational content.</p>
